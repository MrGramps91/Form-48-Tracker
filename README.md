# Form-48-Tracker
Simple tracking system

**UPDATE** UI_ver1.1 -  Implemented a checkbox feature, which will work in conjunction with the delete to allow fields no longer in use to be deleted. Line 23 and Line 28, Created an label object to be used as an empty label placholder to even out the text field label names. Lines 42-43 allow text boxes to be created in the empty placeholder column along side the textfields.

**UPDATE** UI_ColorRenderer - Changes made to the project are the removal of the original checkbox system in favor of a simple (Yes or No) option. This portion of the project is to implement the DefaultCellRenderer method into the GUI to take the 'Turned in?' col as an argument to determine the status of the users form.
 
**UPDATE** 21 March 2018 UI_ColorRenderer or Gui is updated to reflect the subclass implementation of the custom renderer. I also added the RowColorRendere.java file that adds the beta custom cell renderer class.
