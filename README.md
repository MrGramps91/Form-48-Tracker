# Form-48-Tracker
Simple tracking system

**UPDATE** UI_ver1.1 -  Implemented a checkbox feature, which will work in conjunction with the delete to allow fields no longer in use to be deleted. Line 23 and Line 28, Created an label object to be used as an empty label placholder to even out the text field label names. Lines 42-43 allow text boxes to be created in the empty placeholder column along side the textfields.
